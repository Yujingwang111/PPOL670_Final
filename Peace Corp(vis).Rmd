**Problem definition**
The lockdown and quarantine measures issued worldwide in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic have brought a series of impacts on daily life. Unfortunately, most of the effects of COVID-19 and the resulting lockdown have been shockingly negative - rising deaths, unemployment and the imminent global financial crisis are the most frequently reported problems around the world. 

While COVID-19 has brought about many negative effects, it has also brought about some positive changes. For example, crime rates have decreased. From 1.10% (3.1 million) in 2019 to 0.93% (2.6 million) in 2020, the percentage of people aged 12 and older who are victims of violent crime has decreased by 15%. In addition, property crime declines from 7.37% (9.8 million) of households in 2016 to 6.19% (7.9 million) of households in 2020 (Morgan & Thompson, 2022).
Therefore, as international students, we are interested in examining the changes in crime rates before and after the COVID-19 in the District of Columbia where we study and live. 

However, studies have shown that the decline in crime rate does not mean that all crimes have decreased. Because there are obvious differences between the different types of crime in the relationship between epidemiology and crime, it is important to study the types of crimes classified in the study of the relationship between COVID-19 and crime rate. It is almost always undesirable to study crime as an undifferentiated whole (Cornish & Smith,2012).
Moreover, several armed robberies occurred in the Georgetown neighborhood from February to April 2022. Therefore, we wanted to primarily examine property crime rates in the District of Columbia. Here, we divide the years 2017-2022 into three periods: before the epidemic (2017-2019), during the  epidemic (2020-2021), and after the  epidemic (2022-). We will use the crime data in Open Data DC to examine the changes in property crime rates in DC before and during the epidemic. Meanwhile, based on the existing data, we will build models to predict property  crime rates in DC after the epidemic.

**Data extraction**
For this project, we use crime data for the city of Washington DC, which are available from 2017 onwards on the city’s open data portal. Crime data for city of Washington DC available from their open data portal at: https://opendata.dc.gov. To make analysis manageable, we utilized the data from 2017-2021. We downloaded the DC crime data for 5 years,  put them into a folder called “data”.

Because we focus on property crime, after reading the data, we cleaned up the data. We split the time, month and year of the crime according to the original data. It not only lays the foundation for the following visualization, but also facilitates our prediction models.
